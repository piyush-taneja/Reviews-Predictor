# Reviews-Predictor
The goal of this project is to predict the reviews of a restaurant given by the customers using Natural Language Processing Technique.
Natural Language Processing is about analysing text.These text could be books, reviews html web pages that is extracted from web scratching and therefore Natural Language Processing is a brach of Machine Learning where we do some predicted analysis on text. Here text is going to be reviews of restraunts and we will make Machine Learning model that will predict whether the reviews were positive or negative. This is a simple project of NLP.This project code can also be applied to books as well as html web pages.
